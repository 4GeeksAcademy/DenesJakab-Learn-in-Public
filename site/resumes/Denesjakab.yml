    summary: 
      A boy who graduated in primary education, excited to work with children and especially to improve children's perception of education. I have worked with children in Ireland for three years and I am very happy. However, I am eager to discover new horizons and new learning opportunities, excited to learn programming and explore a new world. 
      I hope to learn a lot in the bootcamp and continue developing myself as a professional once the bootcamp is over.
